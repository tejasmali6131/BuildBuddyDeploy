# BuildBuddy Free Hosting Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your BuildBuddy application using:
- **Vercel** (Frontend hosting)
- **Cloudinary** (File storage - Completely Free!)  
- **Render** (Backend hosting)

All services offer free tiers suitable for your project.

## Prerequisites

1. GitHub account (for code hosting)
2. Cloudinary account (free)
3. Vercel account
4. Render account

## Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

âœ… **You've already done this!** Your code is on GitHub.

## Step 1.5: Install New Dependencies

Before deploying, install the Cloudinary dependencies:

```bash
# In your backend folder
cd backend
npm install cloudinary multer-storage-cloudinary

# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add Cloudinary dependencies"
git push origin main
```

## Step 2: Setup Cloudinary (100% Free File Storage)

### 2.1 Create Cloudinary Account

1. Go to [Cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/)
2. Click "Sign up for free"
3. Create your account (no billing required!)
4. Choose a unique cloud name (this will be part of your URLs)

### 2.2 Get Cloudinary Credentials

1. After signup, you'll be taken to the Dashboard
2. Copy these three values from your dashboard:
   - **Cloud Name** 
   - **API Key**
   - **API Secret** (click "Reveal" to see it)

### 2.3 Cloudinary Free Tier Benefits

- **25GB storage** (vs Firebase's 1GB)
- **25GB bandwidth** per month
- **No billing account** required
- Support for images, videos, and PDFs

### 2.3 Test Cloudinary Setup

1. In your Cloudinary dashboard, go to "Media Library"
2. You can test upload functionality later after deployment
3. Files will be stored in `buildbuddy/portfolios/` folder automatically

**That's it!** No complex rules or billing setup needed.

## Step 3: Deploy Backend to Render

### 3.1 Create Render Account

1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up with your GitHub account

### 3.2 Create Web Service

1. Click "New +" and select "Web Service"
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Select your BuildBuddy repository
4. Configure the service:
   - **Name**: `buildbuddy-backend`
   - **Environment**: `Node`
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Root Directory**: `backend`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`

### 3.3 Configure Environment Variables

In the Render dashboard, go to "Environment" tab and add these variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_key_here_make_it_long_and_random
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_from_step_2.2
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_from_step_2.2
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_from_step_2.2
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-app-name.vercel.app
```

### 3.4 Deploy Backend

1. Click "Create Web Service"
2. Wait for the deployment to complete (5-10 minutes)
3. Note your backend URL: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

### 3.5 Test Backend

Visit `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/health` to verify deployment.

## Step 4: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

### 4.3 Configure Environment Variables

In the deployment configuration, add this environment variable:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-app.onrender.com/api
```

**Note:** The frontend doesn't need Cloudinary credentials since file uploads are handled by the backend.

### 4.4 Deploy Frontend

3. Test file uploads (portfolio management)
4. Verify files are stored in Cloudinary

### 6.2 Verify Cloudinary Storage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend sleeps on Render free tier**
   - First request after inactivity may be slow
   - Consider upgrading to paid plan for production

2. **CORS errors**
   - Verify CORS_ORIGIN environment variable matches your Vercel URL exactly
   - Ensure both http and https protocols are handled

3. **Cloudinary upload errors**
   - Check Cloudinary credentials in Render environment variables
   - Verify Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret are correct
   - Check browser console for detailed error messages

4. **Build failures**
   - Check node version compatibility
   - Verify all dependencies are in package.json
   - Check build logs for specific errors
